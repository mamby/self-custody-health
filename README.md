Personal health vault. Local-first, encrypted, and fully user-controlled. No backend, no tracking, no cloud required.

Personal Health Vault is a privacy-first health app for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS. It helps people organize personal medical records, documents, treatments, appointments, reminders, emergency contacts, and health summaries while keeping their health data on their own devices.

## Project Status

This project is in early development.

The current goal is to build a safe, local-first foundation before adding more advanced features such as document import, export, encrypted backup, OCR, and local AI assistance.

Personal Health Vault is not ready for production use with real medical data yet.

## Core Principles

- Local-first by default
- Encrypted storage on the device
- No backend required
- No tracking
- No ads
- No cloud account required
- No cloud AI required
- User-controlled backup only when explicitly enabled
- Health data should never leave the device in plaintext

## What It Does

Personal Health Vault is designed to help users keep a private, structured copy of their health information, including:

- Medical documents
- Treatments and medications
- Appointments
- Reminders
- Vaccinations
- Emergency contacts
- Personal health summary
- Important notes for future consultations
- Future encrypted export and backup flows

## What It Is Not

Personal Health Vault is not a medical device, diagnostic app, emergency app, or replacement for a healthcare professional.

It does not provide:

- Medical advice
- Diagnosis
- Emergency recommendations
- Triage
- Prescriptions
- Clinical certification
- Regulatory compliance claims

Do not use this app as a replacement for a doctor, pharmacist, emergency service, hospital system, or official medical record platform.

## Privacy Model

Personal Health Vault follows a simple privacy model:

- Health data is stored locally by default.
- Saved vault data is encrypted.
- The app does not require a backend to work.
- The app does not send health data to a server.
- The app does not include ads or tracking.
- Backup and sync, when added, must be user-controlled.
- Backup data must be encrypted before leaving the device.
- Backup providers must never receive plaintext health data.

## Security Model

The app uses a local encrypted vault model.

Plaintext health data should only exist in memory while the app is actively using it. Saved records should be encrypted before being written to disk.

Current security boundaries:

- Vault data is encrypted locally.
- Device biometric or credential unlock can be used as an app access gate.
- App lock is separate from vault encryption.
- Biometric unlock must not be described as hardware-bound encryption unless that is guaranteed on every supported platform.
- Real health data must never be committed to the repository.

## Supported Platforms

- iOS
- Android
- Windows
- macOS through Mac Catalyst

## Tech Stack

- .NET 11 preview
- C# preview
- .NET MAUI
- xUnit v3
- Microsoft Testing Platform
- Authenticated encryption
- Platform biometric and device unlock APIs

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mamby/personal-health-vault.git
cd personal-health-vault
```

Restore dependencies:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Build the app:

```bash
dotnet build
```

Run tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```

For platform-specific MAUI builds, use the target framework that matches your platform.

Example for Windows:

```bash
dotnet build src/PersonalHealthVault/PersonalHealthVault.csproj -f net11.0-windows10.0.19041.0
